# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Beach Obby

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A single-player obstacle course game in Roblox Studio that challenges players to complete a series of progressively difficult levels, 
with checkpoint saves and dynamic in-game elements like moving platforms and traps.



## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project will be a one-player obstacle course (obby) game built in Roblox Studio using Lua scripting. The game will consist of multiple levels, 
each designed with increasing difficulty and unique challenges like moving platforms, rotating obstacles, lava jumps, and more. Players will be able 
to save their progress after completing each level so they can return to the same point even after exiting the game. We’ll use Lua to script features like player check-ins, 
obstacle behaviors, timed challenges, and level transitions. The game will also include a basic UI that shows level progress, time taken, and a reset button in case the player 
wants to start over. Our design focus is on making the game fun, intuitive, and smooth to play.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A functioning obby with at least 3 playable levels

Checkpoint system for saving progress

Basic UI for progress tracking



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

3 levels with increasing difficulty

Save/load system that persists across sessions

At least 2 dynamic obstacle types (e.g., lava, falling platforms)

A themed background and audio



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

3-4 levels with unique challenges

In-game timer for speed runs

Simple animations for traps

Start screen and end-of-game celebration sequence

Level selection menu with unlocked levels?



## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next steps include learning more about Lua scripting, especially how to implement save systems using Roblox’s DataStoreService, and how to create obstacle mechanics using 
Roblox parts and scripts. We'll research game loop logic, player checkpoints, UI elements, and camera manipulation. One of us will focus more on scripting the logic 
(e.g., movement of obstacles, saving progress), while the other will concentrate on building the levels and designing the UI. We will work together on overall game design and testing.
